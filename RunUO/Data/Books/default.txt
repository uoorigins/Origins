A Raised Fist's Progress
Willem Woidswuth
PREFACE
---------------
This classic epic of 
Britannian literature 
is one of those works 
one must read before 
they die. Hence 
many citizens save 
it for life insurance.
  While it is turgid 
going indeed, it 
offers a sample of 
the formal poetic 
styles prevalent two 
hundred years ago, 
when iambs roamed 
the land freely and 
sonnets were not yet 
extinct.
  The "garland of 
sonnets" form 
consisteth of 
fourteen sonnets, 
where the last line 
of one sonnet 
be the first line of 
the next; and the last 
line of the fourteenth 
sonnet is the first 
line of the first one. 
Lastly, the "crown" 
or fifteenth sonnet 
doth consist solely of 
the first lines of the 
other fourteen.
  This is the only 
known instance of 
this form in 
Britannian literature, 
perhaps because it be 
too pedantic to suffer 
to live.
  Woidswuth lived 
and died long ago 
enough to be studied 
in schools. Little is 
known of his life, 
save that he willed 
his second-best hat 
to his cousin Javlin 
Wiggle. A member of 
the Romantic School, 
he also dabbled in 
painting, and 
illustrated many of 
his own books.
A RAISED FIST'S 
PROGRESS

I. I First Notice 
Something Wrong 
With Heaven

The surest sign of 
  love is jealousy;
Without a warning or 
  compassion, with
Little thought of 
  consequence, it 
  creeps,
A slow and certain 
  sleuth, along the 
  bliss-
Ful wedding halls, 
  around the Nuptial 
  bed.
It eyes your lover's 
  friends, and 
  ruptures old
Acquaintanceships; it 
  plays the organ-led
Last waltz, the 
  dance that feels so 
  empty cold.
It is a sign, erected 
  high, like grass
Upon a grave, like 
  flowers on a hill--
Like tripping to fall 
  right on your blind 
  ass
And landing eyes 
  wide can give you 
  the will
To find the sparkles, 
  glimmerings 
  bewitched
In water in a 
  storm-filled 
  stagnant ditch.

II. I Set Off On A 
Quest To Find A 
Purer Paradise Than 
Nature Offers Man

In water in a 
  storm-filled 
  stagnant ditch
I found the images of 
  Camelot.
So I set off, bade love 
  farewell, and 
  wished
My way 
  along the questing 
  path. A motley
Figure I was; my 
  friends said Stay! 
  You've found
A heaven here at 
  home! But I saw 
  much
In that rainwater 
  puddle: free and 
  boundless
Generosity, without 
  the inching
Flaws I saw in what 
  was merely love.
The path to find 
  perfection clear to 
  me,
I undertook a classic 
  quest, to solve
Away the weeping 
  worm of jealousy.
How could home seem 
  filled with hope and 
  freedom,
Seeing the beauty of 
  the earth so free?

III. I Am Punished 
For My 
Impertinence; It 
Merely Makes Me 
Strive
